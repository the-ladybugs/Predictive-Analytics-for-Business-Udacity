### Part 5: [A/B Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud979)
- Understood the fundamentals of A/B testing, including experimental design, variable selection, and analyzing and interpreting results.

- Project: [A/B Test a New Menu Launch](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Business-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/5-AB-Testing/5.1-AB-Test-a-New-Menu-Launch.ipynb)

### Part 6: [Time Series Forecasting](https://www.udacity.com/course/time-series-forecasting--ud980)
- Understood trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data. 
- Used time series decomposition plots. 
- Built ETS and ARIMA models.

- Project: [Forecast Video Game Sales](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Business-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/6-Time-Series-Forecasting/6.1-Forecast-Video-Game-Sales.ipynb)

### Part 7: [Segmentation and Clustering](https://www.udacity.com/course/segmentation-and-clustering--ud981)
- Understood the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. 
- Scaled data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. 
- Used principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. 
- Built and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model.
Then completed a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.

- Project: [Predictive Analytics Capstone](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Business-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/7-Segmentation-and-Clustering/7.1-Combining-Predictive-Techniques.ipynb)
