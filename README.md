- Understood the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. 
- Scaled data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. 
- Used principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. 
- Built and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model.
Then completed a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.
